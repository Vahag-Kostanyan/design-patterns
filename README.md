# Design Patterns in PHP & TypeScript

## 📚 Project Overview

Welcome to the **Design Patterns Project**! This repository offers an in-depth exploration of essential design patterns using both **PHP** and **TypeScript**. Each pattern is presented with real-world examples to help developers master their implementation across two powerful programming languages.

## 🛠️ Patterns Implemented

### 🔨 Creational Patterns

- **Singleton Pattern** – A design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one object.
- **Builder Pattern** – Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation.

<!-- ### 🏗️ Structural Patterns

- **Adapter Pattern** – Allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together.
- **Decorator Pattern** – Dynamically adds behavior or responsibilities to objects.

### 🔄 Behavioral Patterns

- **Observer Pattern** – Establishes a one-to-many dependency between objects.
- **Strategy Pattern** – Enables selecting algorithms at runtime. -->
